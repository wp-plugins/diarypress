DiaryPress is a plugin designed to allow your blog to operate like a diary.

== Description ==

DiaryPress is a plugin designed to allow your blog to operate like a diary. It will disable RSS feeds to keep your blog private and ask you to login in order to access the content. This is handy even if you run your diary on a local web server such as WAMP as it protects your blog against nosey family and friends.
